     <p> I'm Mark B-Jay Villa, I'm 19 years old. My birthday is on March 16, 2002 and I live at Brgy. Tanauan Tanza, Cavite. I'm currently taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) at Cavite State University (CvSU).

     <p> I love my family so much, I can't even think living my life without them. We're not very close to each other but we take time to have some fun once in a while. 
     I'm the eldest son of Edwin T. Villa and Ervie Joy Balenia, I have 3 siblings. My mother own a small sari-sari store, and my father is one of the official in our Barangay.
     It's kinda funny that all of my siblings name including mine start with Mark, the second eldest is Mark James followed by Mark Chico and Mark Xian. I think our father take
     our first name in his favourite basketball player. I love singing and reading, it makes me happy everytime I do it. I'm trying to do some short song covers when I have a spare time.
     I love music because it takes my problems away when I listen to it.
